This new monster will be affected by the following modding commands and there should be an #end command at the end. It is not necessary to set a monster number when creating a new monster.

If a monster number is not used, Dominions will automatically use the first free number from 3500+ for the monster.

Using lower hard coded numbers later in the mod may overwrite the number initially assigned by a numberless #newmonster command.",
