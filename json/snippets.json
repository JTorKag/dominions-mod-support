Use a minus sign before the value when using it in this manner for the command to work correctly.  Example, Five monsters with a #montag 2500 could be set as random monster summons by assigning #summon2 -2500 to another monster. This would result in two random monsters from those five being summoned.  The monster tag can also be used as damage value for summoning spells which will then summon a random monster from the group with the same tag. To use it that way set spell damage to [minus]."
