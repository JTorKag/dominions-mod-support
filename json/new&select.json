It is not recommended to use a monster number with monsters that have unique names like Sorceress of the Sacred Fire because that will reduce the risk of conflicts between mods. If a monster number is not used, Dominions will automatically use the first free number from 3500+ for the monster. In this instance all references to the monster in other modding (such as spells or magic sites) must be by name. Using lower hard coded numbers later in the mod may overwrite the number initially assigned by a numberless #newmonster command."
