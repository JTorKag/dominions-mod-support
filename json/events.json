They speak of a distant age, when giants walked the earth and fought battles of such magnitude that was never seen again in the world of mortals. It seems the long dead inhabitants of this city were peaceful farmers worshiping their benevolent Lord in peace and piety. Their knowledge of science, astrology and agriculture were advanced, drawing the envy of rivaling nations. From the far north came frost giants, pillaging and destroying the fertile lands with their hatred and bitterly cold winters. Their civilization threatened with destruction, the elders of the city turned to powerful magic, summoning dragons to fight the intruders. The leader of the enemy giants was killed, but still the city fell, its splendor torn down, its glorious temples destroyed, its elders beheaded in the square. The once proud city-state dwindled into obscurity, only remembered in legends. You surmise this could be an account of a war between the earlier civilizations of Niefelheim and Ur. Notably, the capital of the latter was known as the First City. Further studies may yield more details.",
