## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Release Notes

There is likely errors in my data for all the commands. I did a lot of scraping and regex instead of going through it by hand. If you catch any and are feeling extra generous please fix and submit a pull request. Or if not and it's small just let me know via discord @zegma and I can include the fix in during an update. 

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Dominions Mod Support


**Enjoy!**
