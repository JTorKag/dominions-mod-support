Addtional details including relevent tables for some keywords. Will add more in the future

## Known Issues

I'm sure there's a handful. Just undocumented so far. See below.

## Release Notes

There is likely errors in my data for all the commands. I did a lot of scraping and regex instead of going through it by hand. If you catch any and are feeling extra generous please fix and submit a pull request. Or if not and it's small just let me know via discord @zegma and I can include the fix in during an update. 

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Dominions Mod Support

### Credits
I wanted to highlight [djmcgill](https://github.com/djmcgill/vscode-syntax-highlighting-dominions-5-) for creating a syntax highlighting tool years ago. Used that for a while and the decided I wanted to improve on that base. 
Thanks loggy for the list of mod manual missing commands. 

**Enjoy!**
